HelloMundo
==========

An application for Android that updates the wallpaper with beautiful live pictures
of places from all around the world!
The images are fetched every 30 minutes from LIVE webcams so you can always see the
current view of the chosen location.

Explore the world, and enjoy the view!

You can choose a specific cam or select random mode to be surprised at every refresh.
A widget is also available if you prefer to keep your current wallpaper.
The refresh frequency can be adjusted in the settings.
You can also add your own cams to the list.

HelloMundo was formerly known as "WorldTour".
